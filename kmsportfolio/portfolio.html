                <h4><b>Great Basin Fiber Arts Fair Website</b></h4>
                <p>From 2014 to 2018, I volunteered with the Great Basin Fiber Arts Fair. I headed up the
                  classes section of the fair and increased class attendance by 100%. I helped to design
                  this page of the website which was written using Wix.</p>

                <h4><b>Garden Dynamics Website</b></h4>
                <p>I attended the Lehi Spring Cohort of Tech Moms in 2022. This is an
                  8 week coding bootcamp where we learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and were
                  introduced to careers in tech. Our graduation project was to create and present
                  a website. I designed and wrote this website from scratch for my
                  brother-in-law's business, Garden Dynamics. I also created his logo. The form on
                  the Availability page was written so that his customers could contact him, but
                  so that his information is not viewable online. I had to teach myself PHP in a
                  week to be able to add the form to his website.</p>

                <p>I volunteered as the Webmaster for the American Fork Family Search Center
                  in early
                  2023.
                  The website was created using Google Sites and was mostly complete when I
                  took over
                  the
                  project. I designed the footer and much of the Consultants Resources page. I
                  also
                  learned OnceHub to manage the scheduling of appointments for the site. I
                  will
                  maintain
                  and update the site going forward.</p>
