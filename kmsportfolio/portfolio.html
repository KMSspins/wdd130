                            <p>From 2014 to 2018, I volunteered with the Great Basin Fiber Arts Fair. I headed up the
                                classes section of the fair and increased class attendance by 100%. I helped to design
                                this page of the website which was written using Wix.</p>

                            <p>I attended the Lehi Spring Cohort of Tech Moms in 2022. This is an
                                8 week coding bootcamp where we learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and were
                                introduced to careers in tech. Our graduation project was to create and present
                                a website. I designed and wrote this website from scratch for my
                                brother-in-law's business, Garden Dynamics. I also created his logo. The form on
                                the Availability page was written so that his customers could contact him, but
                                so that his information is not viewable online. I had to teach myself PHP in a
                                week to
                                be able to add the form to his website.</p>

                            <p>I volunteered as the Webmaster for the American Fork Family Search Center in early
                                2023.
                                The website was created using Google Sites and was mostly complete when I took over
                                the
                                project. I designed the footer and much of the Consultants Resources page. I also
                                learned OnceHub to manage the scheduling of appointments for the site. I will
                                maintain
                                and update the site going forward.</p>
